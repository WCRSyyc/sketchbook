# sketchbook

This repository is a wrapper to hold all of the WCRS Arduino sketch repositories as submodules.  All
maintained sketches can be obtained by cloning this single repository.

To clone this repository, including the submodules, use
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/WCRSyyc/sketchbook.git
```
from the command line.

The issue tracker for this repository should be used for other sketches that should be
added to this repository, or things that do not belong.  Comments and issues with
individual sketches should go in the issue tracker for that sub module repository.  Issue that affect multiple sketches, or the interaction between them, can go here, **if**
there is no other repository that already groups the related sketches together.
