# sketchbook

This repository is a wrapper to hold all of the Arduino sketch repositories as submodules.  All
maintained sketches can be obtained by cloning this single repository.

To clone this repository, including the submodules, use
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/WCRSyyc/sketchbook.git
```
from the command line.

The issue tracker for this repository should be for other sketches that should be
added to the repository, or things that do not belong.  Comments and issues with
individual sketches should go in the issue tracker for that sketch.  Where the
issue affects multiple sketches, or the interaction between, that can go here, **if**
there is no other repository that already groups the related sketches together.
